## [0.8.20 - 26.11.2024]

Small fix regarding the latest release and the linux system.

Download this one, instead of the 0.8.19 if you are using linux.

If you are using 0.8.19, make this update:

The fix is to make this change in the system/libs/hooks.php

Change
```
require_once LIBS . 'src/plugins.php';
```

Into:
```
require_once LIBS . 'src/Plugins.php';
```

Yeah, we just changed 'p' to 'P' - that's just case-sensitive nature of linux.
